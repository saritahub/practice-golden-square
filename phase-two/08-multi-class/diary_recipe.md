# Diary + Diary Entry Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

```

```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```ruby
# File: lib/diary.rb
class Diary
  def initialize
  end

  def add(entry) # entry is an instance of DiaryEntry
    # Returns nothing
  end

  def all
    # Returns a list of instances of DiaryEntry
  end

  def count_words
    # Returns the number of words in all diary entries
    # HINT: This method should make use of the `count_words` method on DiaryEntry.
  end

  def reading_time(wpm) # wpm is an integer representing
                        # the number of words the user can read per minute
    # Returns an integer representing an estimate of the reading time in minutes
    # if the user were to read all entries in the diary.
  end

  def find_best_entry_for_reading_time(wpm, minutes)
        # `wpm` is an integer representing the number of words the user can read
        # per minute.
        # `minutes` is an integer representing the number of minutes the user
        # has to read.
    # Returns an instance of diary entry representing the entry that is closest 
    # to, but not over, the length that the user could read in the minutes they
    # have available given their reading speed.
  end
end

# File: lib/diary_entry.rb
class DiaryEntry
  def initialize(title, contents) # title, contents are strings
    # ...
  end

  def title
    # Returns the title as a string
  end

  def contents
    # Returns the contents as a string
  end

  def count_words
    # Returns the number of words in the contents as an integer
  end

  def reading_time(wpm) # wpm is an integer representing
                        # the number of words the user can read per minute
    # Returns an integer representing an estimate of the reading time in minutes
    # for the contents at the given wpm.
  end

  def reading_chunk(wpm, minutes) # `wpm` is an integer representing the number
                                  # of words the user can read per minute
                                  # `minutes` is an integer representing the
                                  # number of minutes the user has to read
    # Returns a string with a chunk of the contents that the user could read
    # in the given number of minutes.
    # If called again, `reading_chunk` should return the next chunk, skipping
    # what has already been read, until the contents is fully read.
    # The next call after that it should restart from the beginning.
  end
end
```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Gets all tracks
library = MusicLibrary.new
track_1 = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track.new("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.all # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Constructs a track
track = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
